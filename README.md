# Helveta
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Cheat base written in Rust. NOT COMPLETE! In active development.

# Disclaimer
There's an alternative, currently better, version of Helveta, which is already complete, and written in modern C++, available [here](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/HelvetaCS). This is my first Rust project, so viewer's discretion is adviced. All advice is welcome, and really appreciated, so, if you see anything, please make notice of it [here](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/helveta-rust/issues). Thanks!

A feature list will appear there later down the road.
